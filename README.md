   - Computing a delivery route for the truck
   -  Displaying the neighborhood witht the truck moving from each destination
   -  Create a route for the truck based on the closest distance to the Truck (minimizing Truck distance)
   -  Creating a route for the truck with only right hand turns allowed

**Goals included:**

   - Add sandwich orders to the file containing destinations and time of order.
   - Model the making of sandwich orders
   - Model the delivery of the order
   - User can select a Routing Strategy
   - Customers who have made orders should be able to keep track of the sandwich trucks location 
   - Compare the distances traveled for each strategy on the same set of orders
